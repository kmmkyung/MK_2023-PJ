      STORY_1 : `Ada is the passion project for James Ellis, who also works full time with Gareth Belton of Gentle Folk in the Adelaide Hills. Ada is a relative newcomer to the South Australian wine scene with their first release being born of the 2018 vintage. A viticulturist at heart James is firmly of the belief that all of his wines are made in the vineyard and he is meticulous with his approach to organics across the sites he manages for Ada and Gareth. Before starting Ada, James had worked his way through many of the nations iconic regions with time spent in vineyard and cellar in the Barossa Valley working for Penfolds, Hunter Valley and McLaren Vale where he met James Erskine of Jauma who introduced him to Gareth.`,
      STORY_2 : `Now James has purchased a house in the Barossa and will continue to work in the hills while sourcing precious small parcels from across South Australia. He crafts wines that are truly expressive of the regions they come from whilst also being produced from the grapes that he loves to drink. Skinsy Eden Riesling, McLaren Vale Grenache, Piccadilly Valley Chardonnay, Basket Range Pinot Noir and Barossa Grenache with more to come as James finds his groove and grows. All Ada grapes are from small growers who farm the land respectively and organically. While winemaking is fairly hands off with the only additions being minimal amounts of SO2 when it is necessary.`,
      STORY_3 : `James’ 2021 release is stellar. All five wines are looking great and will continue to evolve across the year. We are thrilled to be working together and cant wait to watch Ada grow into one of the regions most exciting producers.`,

The ferment was hand plunged twice daily and the tank sealed once fermentation was complete. The fruit was allowed to stay on skins for 95 days and then gently basket pressed to neutral french oak barriques. The extended skin contact has enabled every last bit of flavour and texture to be extracted for the beautiful skins. The texture is prolific but not overpowering or detrimental to the balance of the wine. Racked and settled before bottling and contains approx 40ppm total sulphur.`,

The wine is a step up in ripeness from past years, it's also the first year with a portion of whole bunch in the ferment and we really like the result.

      STORY_1 : `A.R.C or A Random Collection was founded in 2017 after musings and dreams from a previous life working restaurant floors. For James and Jessica Audas the vision of working the land, being in touch with nature and living within their means came to life a few years ago when they made the leap from Sydney and ended up with an off grid permaculture farm in West Gippsland Victoria. Many of you have no doubt shared Jess and James journey and it was very exciting a few months ago when we decided that the time was right to take on this exciting brand and let Jess and James dedicate a greater portion of time to growing the grapes they make.`,
      STORY_2 : `When A.R.C started they sourced fruit from a selection of vineyards predominantly in the nearby Mornington Peninsula which allowed them to further learn their craft, experiment and establish a greater vision and direction for the brand. During this time James worked alongside William Downie in both the cellar and vineyards giving up every spare minute he had to immerse himself in hands off winemaking and biodynamic viticulture. Team ARC firmly believe in ethical farming practices and in early 2020 they took on the lease of 3ha of established biodynamic vines just outside the town of Warragul. This amazing site is perched between the foothills of the Strzelecki Ranges to the south and Mount Baw Baw to the north. Its rich red volcanic soils produce wines of elegance, poise and character. In addition to their 3ha they have planted a very exciting close planted vineyard at home (Karinya Grove). This site comprises of Aligote, Chenin Blanc and Gamay grown at 475m in altitude with a permaculture philosophy. We are delighted to see A.R.C evolve as they continue to understand and learn from these magical sites. For Jess and James the work in the cellar is hands off, preferring not to manipulate the wines and rather let them express their fruit and journey. All wines are wild ferment, not filtered or fined and sulphur is only added in small parts where deemed necessary.`,
      STORY_3 : `The playful ARC labels are inspired by flora and fauna special to the couple. The white labels (Mornington Peninsula wines) are characters from their small hobby farm Karinya Grove, while the Black Labels (Gippsland) are flora and fauna from from the vineyards themselves expressing a deep sense of place and nativity of that site. Jess and James have taken the path less travelled and come out with a thrilling release of summer wines. We are so excited to be showcasing these and watching the brand grow over many years to come.`,

With no formal training he has only his palate, an aptitude for precise execution and a sense of experimentation to guide him in his winemaking exploits. It’s this experimentation that allows every release and vintage to be completely different and truly reflective of the years conditions.

          ABOUT : `Acqua Pazza is Dave's kind of loose take on Piquette... but not really. More like just a slightly lower alcohol version of the other Pet Nat's. All of his 'direct pressed' skins [Brachetto, Chardonnay & Riesling] are macerated further with a small water addition, just enough to keep the skins wet. After roughly another 7 days on skins, they are then pressed and bottled when the sugars are just right. Floral, wild strawberries, red cherries, light and fresh but with some underlying structure and density. Disgorged.

Despite the wine pouring like a hardcore orange wine, it's actually quite light, fresh and delicate. Red apples, floral perfume and very pretty.

Pressed after 2 weeks on skins to old oak and then bottled just over 12 months later. Ripe juicy plums and berries with a delicious savoury edge reminiscent of cooler climate Shiraz. Great acidity and tannin structure [although more gentle than the 2016] will see this wine again with a great future...`,

The wines are made in the Barossa alongside those from Delinquente and Greg has been wonderful in keeping an eye on our baby’s during the winter months.`,

All the wines are fermented naturally and spend 5-6 months on full solids in tank. We didn’t plunge or pump the wines preferring to respect the grapes that the season gave to us. All wines remain unfiltered and un-fined with a small dose of sulphur at bottling the only addition.`,

In the cellar Greg takes this organic philosophy forward, all his wines are small-batch and single-vineyard, fermented in stainless steel with wild yeast and without acid adjustments.

          ABOUT : `The Negroamaro for this wine was sourced from the Sherwood Estate in Loxton North, owned by the Proud family – third generation grape growers who have introduced Southern Italian varieties into their vineyards with great success. Dark pink in the glass with heady bubbles, the nose leads you into that dark fruit zone – blackberry, boysenberry, with a touch of savoury herb – aniseed, fennel seed. On the mouth though, it’s all broad, mouth puckering acidity, fresh and piercing. Black cherry fruitiness really playing second fiddle to the bright crunch, the slightly bitter saltiness of marjoram/tarragon herb characters providing more length and interest.`,

Tracing their origins to the island of Sardinia in the south of Italy, these grapes have completely embedded themselves in the warm, dry climate of the Riverland. Salty, saline and super fresh.`,

To this end, the Bassham family have planted a portion of their vineyard to an amalgam of hardy Iberian varieties formed to make the 1.5ltr 'High Crimes' white blend. Arinto and Albarino are the pick of the Iberian whites and complement each other incredibly well in a blend. Arinto maintains its highwire acidity through the most glaring of heatwaves, whilst always bringing a structured, layered, complex stone fruit and orchard fruit profile. The Albarino benefitted most from the cooler season, really showcasing its bright lemon/grapefruit citrus and mineral characters, and brings a lovely pop to this blend.`,

And in a cooler year, it really comes into its own, so Greg jumped at the chance to have a crack at the variety. Herbaceous, almost menthol aromatics jump out the glass, while the palate is all easy-going red berry fruits.`,

They wanted to grip the earth with their toes and use their knowledge of organic farming and permaculture to create their very own wine label. Creating a sense of community was a deep part of this plan, a place to call home and where they could raise their daughter Frankie around home grown food, great music and with a love and appreciation for the land.`,
      STORY_2 : `They lease three vineyards and are planning the planting of two more on their farm, which is located on the outskirts of Mt Gambier, SA. The property and all of the leased vineyards are located on the south side of one of Australia’s youngest volcanoes. Erupting less than 6000 years ago it is filled with water that changes colour with the seasons. Arising from an ancient inland sea made into limestone and now receiving water from underground caves added with our generous rainfall all contributes to the abundance of water stored in underground limestone caves with pockets of flint rock spread below the nearby soils. The limestone filters the water naturally and the result is a pure water thriving with minerality. All this helps make for incredible soil complexity and their cool climate makes for perfect growing conditions and in turn beautiful, elegant and totally unique wines like no other.`,
      STORY_3 : `They make wines that reflect the eccentricities of their own personalities as well as deeply reflecting place and terroir with a minimalistic approach. They use old world wine methods; preferring the challenges of hand picking fruit, open fermenting with indigenous yeast and only adding sulphur when required by the wine. They do not filter or fine wines and they are all bottled on site in their small winery.
      Mount Gambier is a truly unique wine growing region and one that over the next few years is due likely to grow in understanding and popularity. Over the last few years these wines have gone from strength to strength as cuvees have tightened and become more precise. We are very excited to share these wines with you as we welcome Andrew, Louise & Frankie to our Lo-fi family.`,

      STORY_1 : `Sigurd is the story based around Daniel Grahams great grandfather who spawned from Norway. Despite only meeting his great grandfather as a two year old Dan feels an incredible connection to him and his nordic heritage. His middle name is Sigurd and despite copping a small amount of grief through high school he proudly uses it his brand name.`,
      STORY_2 : `His grandfather travelled from Norway to find work in Australia back in the early days (he was 19, so around 1914) and found the quickest way to become a citizen was to join the army, so he was sent over to Europe fight for Australia. A larrikin at heart he was caught AWOL after being shot early into his service and then sent back to the front lines in France as punishment, where he was shot again…. This time in the elbow which made him useless at holding a gun, luckily this time he was sent back to Australia. His stories amongst the family were legendary and his constant smile and mischievous behaviour was always something Daniel related to. For any of you who have met Dan you will of course know this to be true.`,
      STORY_3 : `Daniel grew up in central western New South Wales and from a young age was immersed in grape growing and winemaking. During school holidays he would pick up work with large wineries picking fruit or pruning vines. This led him to Charles Sturt University where he completed his double Wine/Viticulture degree at Wagga Wagga. His desire to understand different regions led him to vintages in New Zealand (Central Otago), Canada (Okanagan Valley), Portugal (Alentejo), France (Hermitage) and Italy (Barolo). After spending some time back in Australia working for Jacobs Creek his desire to start a small label focusing on organically grown grapes stated to burgeon. He knew that the mechanical, conventional way of doing things wasn’t for him and so in 2012 Sigurd was born. He moved to a smaller winery RedHeads studio wines, which he was given the task of re-invigorating. This also allowed Dan to explore his own label on the side. The first wine under Sigurd was a quirky single hogshead of Riesling fermented with Gewürztraminer skins just labeled as the white. From here a red GSM (now GSMN), Rose, Chenin, Syrah and now Carignan have joined the range with fleeting appearances of Adelaide Hills Pinot Noir and Chardonnay.
      Every vintage of Sigurd is subtly different, be it a change in the blend or style to best show off that years conditions. For the most part Dan’s grapes are sourced or grown under organic principles, something he is working hard to have across the board. Once in the cellar his wines are as hands off as possible with only indigenous yeasts used, no adjustments of acid or tannin and minimal sulphur added at bottling (max 30ppm). He is proud of the Barossa Valley and his reds in particular speak of the richness of the terroir while still harbouring an immense freshness and drinkability, not always an easy task in one of Australia’s warmest regions. Dan is one of the most exciting winemakers coming out of the Barossa and we are so thrilled with his evolution over the last few years.`,

          STYLE : 'Red',
          ABOUT : `The Pinot Noir was picked from the same block a week earlier than the Chardonnay, from a cool protected area in a gully which protects the fruit and retains natural acidity. The fruit was hand picked, all at once, across 3 parts of the blocks with 3 different clones, 114/115 and MV6 all offering a different layer to the wine. In the winery, all the fruit is destemmed to retain whole berries, and then some of the stalks were added back to the ferment (around 10%) to create some stalk tannin for structure. Fermented in 1000L wooden vats with a wooden board on top to keep the skins submerged during the fermentation. Pressed off to stainless steel and then racked to 50% new french hogshead and 50% old french hogsheads for elevage. This is racked off lees after 16 months in barrel to tank for another 6 months. A small addition of sulphur is added to the tank before being bottled. This wine delivers wild mushroom and forest berries on the nose with well integrated cedary oak, long soft tannins on the palate with the wild forest berries coming through, a long flavour profile which opens up even more after being decanted and left for an hour before drinking.

      STORY_1 : `Sonnen is the side project of talented Tasmanian viticulturist Luke Andree who makes these small batch wines alongside his day job at Mewstone Wines.`,
      STORY_2 : `The journey into wine for Luke was not an obvious one. After moving to Melbourne in 2010 to pursue a physiotherapy degree and chase his dream of playing representative cricket he got a job working at his local Dan Murphy’s. Bit by bit over his two years at Dan’s he began to feel more intrigued and comfortable around wine and so after finishing his degree he decided to enrol back into university but this time at Charles Sturt for Viticulture and Winemaking. Whist studying he returned to Tasmania and spent a season pruning in the vines at Stefano Lubaina and a year working the wine bar and cellar door at Moorilla.
      It was by chance at one of the first editions of Bottletops that he met Pat Underwood from Little Reddie and was struck by the world of minimal intervention wine. In late 2016 following this meeting he moved up to Victoria and completed his first vintage at the Boomtown Cooperative winery followed by a full season working at both Oakridge and then Mac Forbes where he spent most of his time helping to manage the vineyards. Post the 2019 harvest with Mac he jetted over to his father’s homeland of Germany to complete vintage with fellow Lo-Fi winery Melshimer. Here he pursued his love of Riesling and worked closely with Thorsten in both the vines and cellar.`,
      STORY_3 : `It was however, the time with Mac that really made him fall in love with the viticultural side of things and what led him back to Tasmania in late 2019 to head up the vineyard and cellar at the very ambitious Mewstone Wines. Here Luke manages almost 6 hectares under vine with the vineyard recently becoming certified organic and he helps make both the Mewstone and Hughes & Hughes wines in their new cellar at the home vineyard in Flowerpot. This is where he makes his Sonnen Wines.
      Sonnen for Luke is the exploration of all he has learnt across his short journey in wine. He wants the wines to speak deeply of Tasmania and the vineyards they are sourced from but have an experimental edge when it comes to winemaking. His release from 2021 wowed us, with his Jannis Riesling a particular highlight, almost reminiscent of the orange wines of Melsheimer. Luke is helping to forge a new path of minimal intervention wines in Tasmania and we cant wait to see Sonnen shine in the years to come.`,

      STORY_1 : `Christian Tschida cultivates 10 hectares of old vines in the Neusiedlersee region of Burgenland. His vineyards are planted on sandy gravel, schist, and limestone soils and have been in the family for 4 generations. This area of Burgenland has a unique microclimate due to the moderating influence of the vast Lake Neusiedlersee nearby.`,
      STORY_2 : `Christian has a very hands off approach in his vineyards, preferring to let nature take its course. His wild looking parcels are instantly recognisable - overgrown with cover crops that both preserve biodiversity in the vineyards and force the vines to bury their roots deep into the soils in search of nutrients.`,
      STORY_3 : `For Christian, the crucial decision comes at harvest time when he is meticulous about picking the fruit at the optimal point of ripeness - something he judges by taste rather than by measuring the technical sugar levels. In the cellar Christian is both experimental and traditional - constantly trying new vinification techniques but never employing high tech equipment. His wines are all foot stomped, spontaneously fermented in closed tanks that sit outside in the shade, and racked with the help of gravity.
      Christian is spearheading a new wave of great Austrian producers with a non-apologetic, genuine and credible approach.`,

      STORY_1 : `Claus Preisinger’s winery is nestled in the village of Gols by Lake Neusiedlersee in Burgenland. Claus first started making wine with this father as a hobby, but after working with Hans Nittnaus, a neighbouring winemaker for a few years, decided that wine was his true calling. In 2004 he was one of the founding members of the Pannobile group of winemakers, a group that uses respect for the land and terroir to preserve traditions in Burgenland. His first vintage was in 2000, and since then he has expanded his father’s 3 hectares to the 17 hectares of vines he cultivates today. His vineyard work is meticulous and he is deeply in touch with his land. He uses a mixture of techniques including homeopathic teas, compost from cattle and horses and works strictly from Steiner philosophies. His vines are spread across 58 parcels and are largely planted to indigenous varieties such as Zweigelt, Blaufränkisch and St. Laurent.`,
      STORY_2 : `More recently Claus has started working with Grüner Veltliner and Weissburgunder, producing distinctive, skin fermented white wines. Despite the modernity of his striking winery everything done inside is hands-off and inherently natural, with indigenous yeasts taking control of each years ferments. Claus’ priority has always been to produce wine that is pure, balanced, and expressive of his terroir. His winemaking methods are very much guided by instinct rather than set formula, and he is perpetually experimenting and evolving, making wine that is markedly different in style to the classic interpretations coming out of the region. Claus was one of the first Austrian winemakers to start experimenting with skin contact wines fermented in Georgian amphorae. His 2009 Weissburgunder from the Edelgraben vineyard was the first vintage he bottled in this style, and since then he has been vinifying the whole Edelgraben range in amphorae.`,
      STORY_3 : `Claus is deeply committed to working in harmony with nature, and has been certified biodynamic since 2009. He also keeps his cellar interventions to a minimum, strongly advocating for wines that achieve balance naturally. Very little sulphur is added to his wines - Claus decides just before bottling if it is strictly necessary.
      Claus is spearheading a new wave of great young Austrian producers with a non-apologetic, genuine and credible approach. Indigenous varietals take staring roles in his production and his examples are bright, pure and instinctual.`,

      STORY_1 : `In just his early 30’s, Michael Gindl is one of the most exciting young winemakers helping to lead Austria’s resurgence on the modern wine scene. When Michael finished agricultural school in 2002 it was clear that he wanted to run the farm that his family had owned since 1807. This farm has always practiced mixed agriculture with crops, livestock, forestry and wine. Michael was fascinated with fermentation and took over the responsibility for vinification during his school years. He followed the common doctrine but was never happy with his early wines. It was only through stepping back and looking at the wines of his grandfather, a man who worked much more simply, with nearly no manipulation or intervention that Michael found his style and mantra. In 2012 Inspired by this he converted his winery and vineyards to Demeter bio-dynamics and began experimenting. Now Michael takes holistic farming to new heights with what he calls ‘close-circuit bio-dynamics’ - nothing comes into the winery, nothing comes out. This includes his barrels, which he makes himself from Acacia wood from the nearby forest.`,
      STORY_2 : `His 10 hectares of vines are planted extremely densely, with 7,000-10,000 vines per hectare growing on loam and loess soil. This forces the vines to behave highly competitively, resulting in low yields of highly concentrated fruit. He uses cover crops to keep down weeds and pest control is handled by the buzzards (Buteos) that roam the vineyards. He tucks his shoots instead of cutting them off at the top so that the energy of the plant goes to the fruit, rather than the stress of making new shoots at the cut end. A plethora of animals also inhabit the Gindl farm. Highland cattle have been bred since 2012, his 3 horses manage all of the work in the vineyards and a flock of goats and Breton dwarf sheep help to manage the weeds and increase fertility.`,
      STORY_3 : `In 2012 along with his certification Michael decided to rename and brand his property. He landed on MG vom Sol. Sol is the oldest vineyard ever documented in his hometown of Hohenruppersdorf, with plantings dating back to the 14th century. His grandfather revitalised this site, replanting to Gruner Veltliner and Weissburgunder 45 years ago. This remains the only Single Vineyard wine he makes preferring to harvest his 10 hectares by hand in three passes, picking on flavour and ripeness to create his special blends. To preserve the individuality and genuineness obtained in the vineyards, Michael try’s to do as little as possible in the cellar. The grapes are pressed very gently, rarely racked and fermented spontaneously without any use of selected yeast or temperature control. The wines remain on the lees for a very long time and selected cuvees get a small dose of sulphur dioxide before bottling.
      Michaels is above all a farmer and a very talented one at that. His love for his vines, animals and their interaction makes his one of the most inspiring people we have come across. His wines are pure, unique, and energetic speaking deeply from the land on which they are grown.`,

The name “Flora” thus expresses not only the fresh and aromatic style of the wine itself, but also the situation in the vineyards from which it originates. The 2016 is a bit different bottled with a small amount of residual sugar and under crown seal. It drinks like a cross between a petillant natural and a gassy Mosel riesling. This vintage is Riesling dominant with a touch of Gelber Muskateller. Bottled unfiltered with 15ppm SO2 at bottling.`,

The vineyards from which the two grow their fruit are farmed without chemicals and all harvesting is done by hand. The cellar is located in the town of Uchizy and all of the fruit is pressed in a hand-driven press and no additions are made at any point. The same barrels are used for the same wine each year as they believe that the yeast & bacteria’s are in symbiosis with the fruit from the vineyards. All wines are bottled without sulphur and total production is minuscule with less than 5,000 bottles in a fruitful year`,

      COMPANY_IMG : '',
      STORY_1 : `We are thrilled to introduce many of you to the wonderful wines of Amaury Beaufort. Some will know the Beaufort name here in Australia and after making the wines of his family estate for many years he recently broke away from the family business to focus on his own Champagne project. In late 2021 Amaury Beaufort released his first champagne under his own name, from a 0.88ha champagne parcel called Le Jardinot in Polisy and we are delighted to have just received a small top up of stock just in time for Christmas.`,
      STORY_2 : `After completing viticultural studies in Beaune in 2005, he worked many years for his family estate, Champagne André Beaufort, helping ensure the succession to his own generation. In parallel with the projects of his family, he planted 5ha near Tonnère, and produced still wine from 2007 until 2017 as Les Larmes de Divona. By 2018, Amaury sought a clean break. He split off from his work with the family, and began farming his own 0.88ha parcel in Polisy the way he liked. A gentle, mostly east-facing slope of pinot noir on kimmeridgian clay-limestone, capped with a section of chardonnay on portlandian clay limestone, Le Jardinot (as the parcel and the resultant champagne are called) is bordered on two sides by woodland. Planted in 1972, right after Amaury’s father Jacques Beaufort’s conversion to organics, the parcel has never seen synthetic treatments. It comprised part of Champagne André Beaufort until 2018, when Amaury broke off from the family enterprise to pursue his own champagne production.`,
      STORY_3 : `Beaufort takes care to understate the differences that led him to break from the family estate and his négociant work with his brothers. But it doesn’t take much reading between the lines to see where Amaury’s priorities lie in viticulture. “For me the system is there always needs to be life in the soil,” he says. “Practically all the vignerons who work organically, they farm the vines, but they don’t farm the soil. They plow, they remove all the grass. Then it’s all naked. But there are a lot of microorganisms that need grass cover. I want my soil to play the role of a sponge. So when it rains, it absorbs it, and when it’s dry, only the surface dries out.” Here the under-emphasized issue is that maintaining grass cover entails a drop in yields, and the financial loss is all the more significant in regions where land is astronomically expensive. Beaufort also prefers to avoid vine trimming, finding it encourages root expansion and a greater resistance to pests and problems. Beaufort also credits late, careful pruning, in successive stages, with allowing him to avoid 2021’s catastrophic frosts.
      In the cellar Beaufort ages his vin clairs for up to 21 months, this is extraordinarily long for Champagne vignerons working at his scale. With his close proximity to Burgundy, Amaury’s vinification techniques are more similar to Burgundy than classic Champagne. Fermentation begins in large 15hl oval casks. He doesn’t do battonage by hand, the shape of his casks allows for natural battonage. The wines are then transferred to Demi-muids for settling and further ageing. Wines are full natural fermentation with secondary fermentation from a selection natural yeast cultures the family have been using for over 20 years. No sulphur is added through the process and all wines remain unfiltered and unfined.
      For us this is the most striking Champagne we have come across. It has a remarkable purity and linearity, something commonly seen in the past still wines he has produced. We are immensely proud to be brining these to Australia in extremely small amounts and look forward to expanding his range with a Rose and Coteaux Champenoise in the coming months.`,

      STORY_1 : `The Béru family have owned the historical Château de Béru domain for 400 years. At the beginning of the 20th century when the phylloxera crisis hit all the vines were uprooted leaving the estate without its source of income. It was only in 1987, that the Comte Éric de Béru, out of passion for wine, undertook to replant the entire vineyard, and in particular, the famous monopole vineyard Clos Béru. His wife, Laurence and their daughter Athénaïs are now running the domain. Athénaïs was living in Paris as an insurance broker until 2004 when her father passed away, and she decided to move back to Béru to reclaim the vineyard, which included the painstaking task of converting it to organic, and then biodynamic (now Demeter certified). Her first vintage was 2005 and in the years that have followed she has become one of the most revered and influential winemakers in Chablis.`,
      STORY_2 : `She manages almost 15 hectares on the classic soils of Chablis, kimmeridgian clay and stones, as well as having a small negociant allowing her to play with varieties outside of burgundy during challenging vintages. The Chablis of the domain is produced in a vineyard located on the top of the hill of Béru, above 300 meters. Its terroir was formed during the Kimmeridgian era and is mainly composed of crushed limestone and marine fossils. The vines are approximately 30 years old. The pruning system is guyot double shape and approximately 6500 vines are planted per hectare.`,
      STORY_3 : `Grapes are handpicked at maturity in 10kg crates. The harvest is directly pressed – in a pneumatic press at low pressure. The juice is directly transferred to stainless steel tanks for fermentations. All wines are aged for 14 to 16 months and are bottled without any fining or filtration. The close attention brought at each step of the winemaking process is the key element, which allows for low sulphur vinification or in the case of the single site wines no addition at all.
      Athénaïs wines are with truly inspirational. She leads an amazing team producing wines of incredibly purity and virtue.`,

In 2006 Béru took over a small parcel located in the centre of the Premier Cru Vaucoupin. The vines average 30 years of age. The steepness of the slope prevents the use of tractors. In order to improve the soils' quality, they are now plowed with a horse or manually worked. Aged for 18 months in predominantly old wood with a small sulphur addition at bottling.`,

          ABOUT : `A wall has singled out the Clos Béru for its very unique qualities, since the 13th Century. Year after year, the Clos keeps providing typical brilliant, powerful, round and mineral wines. As is the case in all the great Burgundy terroirs, it only takes a few steps in the parcel to notice significant changes in the nature of the soil, the inclination of the slope or the vigour of the vines. There is more clay here, more lime there, but the soil is mainly calcareous. Further up, a marly streak may emerge. Aged for 24 months in old wood.`,
