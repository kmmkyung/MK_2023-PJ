      STORY_1 : `Ada is the passion project for James Ellis, who also works full time with Gareth Belton of Gentle Folk in the Adelaide Hills. Ada is a relative newcomer to the South Australian wine scene with their first release being born of the 2018 vintage. A viticulturist at heart James is firmly of the belief that all of his wines are made in the vineyard and he is meticulous with his approach to organics across the sites he manages for Ada and Gareth. Before starting Ada, James had worked his way through many of the nations iconic regions with time spent in vineyard and cellar in the Barossa Valley working for Penfolds, Hunter Valley and McLaren Vale where he met James Erskine of Jauma who introduced him to Gareth.`,
      STORY_2 : `Now James has purchased a house in the Barossa and will continue to work in the hills while sourcing precious small parcels from across South Australia. He crafts wines that are truly expressive of the regions they come from whilst also being produced from the grapes that he loves to drink. Skinsy Eden Riesling, McLaren Vale Grenache, Piccadilly Valley Chardonnay, Basket Range Pinot Noir and Barossa Grenache with more to come as James finds his groove and grows. All Ada grapes are from small growers who farm the land respectively and organically. While winemaking is fairly hands off with the only additions being minimal amounts of SO2 when it is necessary.`,
      STORY_3 : `James’ 2021 release is stellar. All five wines are looking great and will continue to evolve across the year. We are thrilled to be working together and cant wait to watch Ada grow into one of the regions most exciting producers.`,

The ferment was hand plunged twice daily and the tank sealed once fermentation was complete. The fruit was allowed to stay on skins for 95 days and then gently basket pressed to neutral french oak barriques. The extended skin contact has enabled every last bit of flavour and texture to be extracted for the beautiful skins. The texture is prolific but not overpowering or detrimental to the balance of the wine. Racked and settled before bottling and contains approx 40ppm total sulphur.`,

The wine is a step up in ripeness from past years, it's also the first year with a portion of whole bunch in the ferment and we really like the result.

      STORY_1 : `A.R.C or A Random Collection was founded in 2017 after musings and dreams from a previous life working restaurant floors. For James and Jessica Audas the vision of working the land, being in touch with nature and living within their means came to life a few years ago when they made the leap from Sydney and ended up with an off grid permaculture farm in West Gippsland Victoria. Many of you have no doubt shared Jess and James journey and it was very exciting a few months ago when we decided that the time was right to take on this exciting brand and let Jess and James dedicate a greater portion of time to growing the grapes they make.`,
      STORY_2 : `When A.R.C started they sourced fruit from a selection of vineyards predominantly in the nearby Mornington Peninsula which allowed them to further learn their craft, experiment and establish a greater vision and direction for the brand. During this time James worked alongside William Downie in both the cellar and vineyards giving up every spare minute he had to immerse himself in hands off winemaking and biodynamic viticulture. Team ARC firmly believe in ethical farming practices and in early 2020 they took on the lease of 3ha of established biodynamic vines just outside the town of Warragul. This amazing site is perched between the foothills of the Strzelecki Ranges to the south and Mount Baw Baw to the north. Its rich red volcanic soils produce wines of elegance, poise and character. In addition to their 3ha they have planted a very exciting close planted vineyard at home (Karinya Grove). This site comprises of Aligote, Chenin Blanc and Gamay grown at 475m in altitude with a permaculture philosophy. We are delighted to see A.R.C evolve as they continue to understand and learn from these magical sites. For Jess and James the work in the cellar is hands off, preferring not to manipulate the wines and rather let them express their fruit and journey. All wines are wild ferment, not filtered or fined and sulphur is only added in small parts where deemed necessary.`,
      STORY_3 : `The playful ARC labels are inspired by flora and fauna special to the couple. The white labels (Mornington Peninsula wines) are characters from their small hobby farm Karinya Grove, while the Black Labels (Gippsland) are flora and fauna from from the vineyards themselves expressing a deep sense of place and nativity of that site. Jess and James have taken the path less travelled and come out with a thrilling release of summer wines. We are so excited to be showcasing these and watching the brand grow over many years to come.`,

With no formal training he has only his palate, an aptitude for precise execution and a sense of experimentation to guide him in his winemaking exploits.

          ABOUT : `Acqua Pazza is Dave's kind of loose take on Piquette... but not really. More like just a slightly lower alcohol version of the other Pet Nat's. All of his 'direct pressed' skins [Brachetto, Chardonnay & Riesling] are macerated further with a small water addition, just enough to keep the skins wet. After roughly another 7 days on skins, they are then pressed and bottled when the sugars are just right. Floral, wild strawberries, red cherries, light and fresh but with some underlying structure and density. Disgorged.

          ABOUT : `The theme for this wine was a skinsy, light, fresh maceration wine that could be drunk anywhere and any time. The fruit was largely destemmed [there was a small whole bunch portion, around 6%] and spent between 11-17 days on skins followed by around 9 months in old French oak. Despite the wine pouring like a hardcore orange wine, it's actually quite light, fresh and delicate. Red apples, floral perfume and very pretty.

          A blend of mostly Nebbiolo or Dolcetto depending on the year. Lighter styled, fruit forward, juicy red fruits, with a backbone of those savoury mountain amaro herbs that Nebbiolo is renowned for. Fresh crunchy acidity to finish. It also drinks well with a bit of a chill. Bright, simple fun drinking... Get on it! 20PPM SO2 addition at bottling.`,

Each individual fermentation was aged separately in old barriques before blending just prior to bottling. Red cherries, raspberries and florals supported by the more savoury, earthy whole bunch characters and brisk acidity keeping you wanting for more. 20PPM SO2 addition at bottling.`,

          Side by side when comparing to the Uraidla, this wine is a slightly more garnet / brick colour, it's more fruit driven with ripe cherries at the forefront and built around more structure. Again the tannins build the longer the wine is open. Free run juice and pressings, 16 day maceration and 13 months élevage in old French Oak. Just over 15 months of bottle age prior to release. This vineyard is managed organically.`,

The fruit was then destemmed and basket pressed approximately 12 hours later directly to old French oak. Typical of Lambrusco, this is the most savoury and meaty wine of the bunch. Turned earth, undergrowth, cured meats, tart pomegranate over dark berry fruits with fresh acidity.`,

          ABOUT : `The first release of Lagrein in 2014 was a smash hit and unfortunately David was unable to source the fruit again in 2015 but from 2016 it's been back and better than ever. Picked a little early to create a livelier, fresher iteration. Super Italian in style, it's packed with dark red fruits over a core of green herbs and earth. Its balance between savoury tannins and racy acidity makes it sit at a spot-on pitch. Don't be deceived by the colour, this is a distinctly fresh medium bodied wine. 20PPM SO2 addition at bottling.`,

          STYLE : 'Red',
          ABOUT : `For those of you that tried the 2016 Sellicks Hill Shiraz you'll know that it was a big boy, built with the structure to last likely a decade or more in the cellar. In 2017 David turned the volume down a little and created a wine that was a little more approachable when young but still retained all the things we loved about the 2016 release. 2017 saw 20% whole bunches, 30% pressed off as rosé juice with the remaining 50% destemmed. Pressed after 2 weeks on skins to old oak and then bottled just over 12 months later. Ripe juicy plums and berries with a delicious savoury edge reminiscent of cooler climate Shiraz. Great acidity and tannin structure [although more gentle than the 2016] will see this wine again with a great future...`,
