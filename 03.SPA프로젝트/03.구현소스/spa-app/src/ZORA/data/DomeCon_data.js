    Education is one of the most effective ways of raising living standards because girls are four times more likely to be out of school than boys from the same background, so we felt compelled to do what we could do to help. ^ To that end, we are partnering up with the Tarkwa Breman Girl’s School (TBGS), operated by Cocoa360, a non-profit organization, pioneering a self-sustaining model of rural development with both a community school (TBGS) and a clinic.`,
