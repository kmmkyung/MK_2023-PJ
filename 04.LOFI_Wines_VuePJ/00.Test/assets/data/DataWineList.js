      STORY_1 : `Ada is the passion project for James Ellis, who also works full time with Gareth Belton of Gentle Folk in the Adelaide Hills. Ada is a relative newcomer to the South Australian wine scene with their first release being born of the 2018 vintage. A viticulturist at heart James is firmly of the belief that all of his wines are made in the vineyard and he is meticulous with his approach to organics across the sites he manages for Ada and Gareth. Before starting Ada, James had worked his way through many of the nations iconic regions with time spent in vineyard and cellar in the Barossa Valley working for Penfolds, Hunter Valley and McLaren Vale where he met James Erskine of Jauma who introduced him to Gareth.`,
      STORY_2 : `Now James has purchased a house in the Barossa and will continue to work in the hills while sourcing precious small parcels from across South Australia. He crafts wines that are truly expressive of the regions they come from whilst also being produced from the grapes that he loves to drink. Skinsy Eden Riesling, McLaren Vale Grenache, Piccadilly Valley Chardonnay, Basket Range Pinot Noir and Barossa Grenache with more to come as James finds his groove and grows. All Ada grapes are from small growers who farm the land respectively and organically. While winemaking is fairly hands off with the only additions being minimal amounts of SO2 when it is necessary.`,
      STORY_3 : `James’ 2021 release is stellar. All five wines are looking great and will continue to evolve across the year. We are thrilled to be working together and cant wait to watch Ada grow into one of the regions most exciting producers.`,

The ferment was hand plunged twice daily and the tank sealed once fermentation was complete. The fruit was allowed to stay on skins for 95 days and then gently basket pressed to neutral french oak barriques. The extended skin contact has enabled every last bit of flavour and texture to be extracted for the beautiful skins. The texture is prolific but not overpowering or detrimental to the balance of the wine. Racked and settled before bottling and contains approx 40ppm total sulphur.`,

The wine is a step up in ripeness from past years, it's also the first year with a portion of whole bunch in the ferment and we really like the result.

      STORY_1 : `A.R.C or A Random Collection was founded in 2017 after musings and dreams from a previous life working restaurant floors. For James and Jessica Audas the vision of working the land, being in touch with nature and living within their means came to life a few years ago when they made the leap from Sydney and ended up with an off grid permaculture farm in West Gippsland Victoria. Many of you have no doubt shared Jess and James journey and it was very exciting a few months ago when we decided that the time was right to take on this exciting brand and let Jess and James dedicate a greater portion of time to growing the grapes they make.`,
      STORY_2 : `When A.R.C started they sourced fruit from a selection of vineyards predominantly in the nearby Mornington Peninsula which allowed them to further learn their craft, experiment and establish a greater vision and direction for the brand. During this time James worked alongside William Downie in both the cellar and vineyards giving up every spare minute he had to immerse himself in hands off winemaking and biodynamic viticulture. Team ARC firmly believe in ethical farming practices and in early 2020 they took on the lease of 3ha of established biodynamic vines just outside the town of Warragul. This amazing site is perched between the foothills of the Strzelecki Ranges to the south and Mount Baw Baw to the north. Its rich red volcanic soils produce wines of elegance, poise and character. In addition to their 3ha they have planted a very exciting close planted vineyard at home (Karinya Grove). This site comprises of Aligote, Chenin Blanc and Gamay grown at 475m in altitude with a permaculture philosophy. We are delighted to see A.R.C evolve as they continue to understand and learn from these magical sites. For Jess and James the work in the cellar is hands off, preferring not to manipulate the wines and rather let them express their fruit and journey. All wines are wild ferment, not filtered or fined and sulphur is only added in small parts where deemed necessary.`,
      STORY_3 : `The playful ARC labels are inspired by flora and fauna special to the couple. The white labels (Mornington Peninsula wines) are characters from their small hobby farm Karinya Grove, while the Black Labels (Gippsland) are flora and fauna from from the vineyards themselves expressing a deep sense of place and nativity of that site. Jess and James have taken the path less travelled and come out with a thrilling release of summer wines. We are so excited to be showcasing these and watching the brand grow over many years to come.`,

With no formal training he has only his palate, an aptitude for precise execution and a sense of experimentation to guide him in his winemaking exploits.

          ABOUT : `Acqua Pazza is Dave's kind of loose take on Piquette... but not really. More like just a slightly lower alcohol version of the other Pet Nat's. All of his 'direct pressed' skins [Brachetto, Chardonnay & Riesling] are macerated further with a small water addition, just enough to keep the skins wet. After roughly another 7 days on skins, they are then pressed and bottled when the sugars are just right. Floral, wild strawberries, red cherries, light and fresh but with some underlying structure and density. Disgorged.

Pressed after 2 weeks on skins to old oak and then bottled just over 12 months later. Ripe juicy plums and berries with a delicious savoury edge reminiscent of cooler climate Shiraz. Great acidity and tannin structure [although more gentle than the 2016] will see this wine again with a great future...`,

All the wines are fermented naturally and spend 5-6 months on full solids in tank. We didn’t plunge or pump the wines preferring to respect the grapes that the season gave to us. All wines remain unfiltered and un-fined with a small dose of sulphur at bottling the only addition.`,

In the cellar Greg takes this organic philosophy forward, all his wines are small-batch and single-vineyard, fermented in stainless steel with wild yeast and without acid adjustments.

          ABOUT : `The Negroamaro for this wine was sourced from the Sherwood Estate in Loxton North, owned by the Proud family – third generation grape growers who have introduced Southern Italian varieties into their vineyards with great success. Dark pink in the glass with heady bubbles, the nose leads you into that dark fruit zone – blackberry, boysenberry, with a touch of savoury herb – aniseed, fennel seed. On the mouth though, it’s all broad, mouth puckering acidity, fresh and piercing. Black cherry fruitiness really playing second fiddle to the bright crunch, the slightly bitter saltiness of marjoram/tarragon herb characters providing more length and interest.`,

          ABOUT : `Fermented using the natural yeasts present in the vineyard, the wine spent 6 weeks on fine lees, giving it a beautiful, textural edge not often found in Australian Vermentino’s. Tracing their origins to the island of Sardinia in the south of Italy, these grapes have completely embedded themselves in the warm, dry climate of the Riverland. Salty, saline and super fresh.`,

          ABOUT : `While the Delinquente wines focus on Southern and Central Italian varieties, the grapes native to the warmer parts of Spain and Portugal and equally as at home in the sun-drenched Riverland. To this end, the Bassham family have planted a portion of their vineyard to an amalgam of hardy Iberian varieties formed to make the 1.5ltr 'High Crimes' white blend. Arinto and Albarino are the pick of the Iberian whites and complement each other incredibly well in a blend. Arinto maintains its highwire acidity through the most glaring of heatwaves, whilst always bringing a structured, layered, complex stone fruit and orchard fruit profile. The Albarino benefitted most from the cooler season, really showcasing its bright lemon/grapefruit citrus and mineral characters, and brings a lovely pop to this blend.`,

          ABOUT : `Nero D'Avola, the famous black grape of Sicily, is just at home in the hot, dry climate of the Riverland as it is in the land of Don Corleone. The Rosato truly is a unique wine. Planted in the comparable climate of the Riverland, it produces a wine that's full of fruit flavour that retain natural acidity. After crushing, the fruit was left to soak on skins for 12 hours, giving the wine it’s bright, almost fluorescent pale pink colour. Dry, lifted and driven by acid.`,

This wine is our attempt at essentially trying to emulate a light, cool climate red, with Negroamaro and Nero d’Avola being the perfect varieties for the task.`,

To this end, the Bassham family have planted a portion of their vineyard to an amalgam of hardy Iberian varieties formed to make the 1.5ltr 'High Crimes' red blend. Graciano may seem like a weird variety for the Riverland - predominantly planted in Rioja and Navarra, cooler regions in the north of Spain – but its late ripening, holds acidity well and produces plush, aromatic fruit that stands up well in the heat. And in a cooler year, it really comes into its own, so Greg jumped at the chance to have a crack at the variety. Herbaceous, almost menthol aromatics jump out the glass, while the palate is all easy-going red berry fruits.`,
