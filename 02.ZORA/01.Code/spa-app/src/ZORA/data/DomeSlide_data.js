    There is a quick hit of grape and lavender at mid-melt. Just a nice fruity wink before the butter note returns and lingers within the chocolate’s comforting warmth.
    It’s a great showcase of Ghanaian beans serving a great mission.”`,

Immediately I get a rich, cocoa aroma and a tinge of caramel sweetness. As I taste the chocolate, I go on this nostalgic chocolatey journey. The decadence and richness of the chocolate are reminiscent of ooey gooey chocolatey brownies.`,
